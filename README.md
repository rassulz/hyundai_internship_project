## ⭐ Core System — Siemens SIMATIC S7-300

### PLC Programming (TIA Portal)

- Developed **ladder logic (LD)** in **Siemens TIA Portal** for SIMATIC S7-300
- Implemented:
  - Start / Stop control
  - Direction switching (Forward / Reverse)
  - Emergency Stop logic (fail-safe)
  - Timer-based delays and sequences
- Integrated digital inputs and outputs via ET modules
- Verified logic using real-time monitoring and testing

The PLC program forms the **central control layer** of the entire system.
